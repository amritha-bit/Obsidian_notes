- *These can Increase the utilization of the Processor and disk leading to better transaction throughput*
- *Reduce average response time for transaction as multiple transaction can run simultaneously*  

#### Deadlock
*A Deadlock happens when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resource but none of them ever proceed because they are stuck waiting*
