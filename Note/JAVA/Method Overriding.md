*Method overloading means when a child class has a same method with the same name return datatype same number of arguments as the parent class
Its also called runtime polymorphism* 

#### Advantages of method overriding
- *The child class can edit and modify the contents of the method without editing the code of the parent class*
- *this is helpful when the parent class have multiple child class  each child class can add its on implementation without editing the source code of the parent class*

- [ ] method overriding and Dynamic method Dispatch

#### Dynamic method dispatch
*Dynamic method dispatch is how java correctly specify which implementation of the overridden method should be run during the runtime based on which object it is referring to*
